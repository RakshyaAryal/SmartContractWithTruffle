# SmartContractWithTruffle
In this project, I have written code using Truffle to create own smart contract. Below are the steps done in this Truffle project.

Step 1: Downloading and Installing Truffle. Also, Contract Creation and compilation is done to start building smart contract.
We can install truffle using command line:-
npm install truffle -g
truffle init (for initializing directory to set up truffle)

Step 2: Migrations done to deploy with migration contract
Step 3: Unit Testing is done writing 2 unit test in this project. We can test our smart contracts to write unit tests to make sure that the logic works as expected before we deploy.
Step 4: Deployment is done by creating account in moralis.io
